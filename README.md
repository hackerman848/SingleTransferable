An implementation of the Single Transferrable Vote voting system, which works on Excel spreadsheets produced by a vote held in a Google Form. 

Notes on usage:

The question to fill the Question name box must be copied exactly from the Google Form, for the program to work. This can be acquired simply from the Google Form, copying it and pasting it into the entry box.
